In this ER-Diagram, the User table has a one-to-many relationship with the Role table, 
indicated by the "1" and "*" symbols. This means that each user can have one role, 
but a role can be associated with multiple users.

The Recipe table has a one-to-many relationship with the Like table. 
Each recipe can have multiple likes, but a like is associated with only one recipe.

The User table is connected to the Recipe table through the like_id and recipe_id 
foreign keys, representing the relationship between users and their liked recipes.

The primary keys are denoted by (PK) and foreign keys are denoted by (FK).
